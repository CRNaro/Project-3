# Warm the Heart

This application is intended to allow the user to search customers and products of Heart Line stove shop and showcase the work of Corri Naglie, Chris Naro, Adam Smith, and Sawyer Baldwin.

## Description

This application provides the employees of Hear Line Stove shop with the ability to create and search customers in the database. Additionally, this project used our knowledge as bootcamp students and encasulated all the aspects of coding design that we have learned throughout the past 6 months.

## Usage

The Warm the Heart application is used by first logging in or signing up. After loggin in, the user has the ability to create a new customer using their name, phone number, and email. From here, the user can search customers, add purchased products to a selected customer, and add notes to a customer file.

## Conclusion

During the creation of this application we learned and sharpened many skills that will be invaluable in future jobs involving computer software engineering and design. The skills used/learned include:

* We furthered our knowledge of React, pages, components, and links.

* We learned how to better debug and run through our application to pin-point and solve issues.

* We advanced our understanding of MongoDB and mongoose syntax and structure.

* Each of us achieved a better understanding of front-end and back-end integration.

* We now have a better understanding of authentication and the use of jwtoken.
